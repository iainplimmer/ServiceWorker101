        <p>We're current experiencing an <b>OFFLINE</b> situation, baby!</p>
        <p>It's important to note that we are still serving in LOCALHOST not LOCALHOST/OFFLINE which means that the scripts need to be pointed from the root of the application and not from the root of the OFFLINE folder.</p>
