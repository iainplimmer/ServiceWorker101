# ServiceWorker101
Website create to learn about service workers and shizzle. 

The application itself only gets data from a single service, then caches that data in localstorage.

If the application goes offline, the cache data is shown on the screen instead of the live data.

Simple? You think but it took a bit of thought the first time I did it :D

To use:

npm install

gulp watch

npm start
